# If you wish to use wandb for logging (it's nice!, recommended).
# 1) Make sure to first log in to wandb, e.g. run:
#    `wandb login`
# 2) Set the WANDB_RUN environment variable when running this script, e.g.:
#    `WANDB_RUN=d26 bash speedrun.sh`
if [ -z "$WANDB_RUN" ]; then
    # by default use "dummy" : it's handled as a special case, skips logging to wandb
    WANDB_RUN=dummy

# Download the first ~2B characters of pretraining dataset
# each data shard is ~250M chars
# so we download 2e9 / 250e6 = 8 data shards at this point
# each shard is ~100MB of text (compressed), so this is about ~800MB of data on disk
# look at dev/repackage_data_reference.py for details on how this data was prepared
python -m nanochat.dataset -n 8
# Immediately also kick off downloading more shards in the background while tokenizer trains
# Approximately 350 shards are needed for 10B tokens of data for pretraining.
# The maximum total number of shards available in the entire dataset is 1822.
